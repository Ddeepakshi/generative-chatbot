Powered by the LLaMA2 model to generate human-like text responses.
Custom prompt templates for better conversational experience using LangChain.
Simple, local deployment with no need for external API keys.
📝 Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x 🐍
Pip (Python's package manager) 📦
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm) 💻
⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLaMA2-Chatbot.git
cd LLaMA2-Chatbot

2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # for Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # for Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download and Run LLaMA2
Make sure you have Ollama installed and running on your machine.

bash
Copy code
ollama run llama2

4. Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run chatbot.py
Once the app is running, a browser window will open where you can start interacting with the chatbot. 🗣️✨

🧠 Prompt Engineering
In this project, we use a prompt template that guides the chatbot on how to respond. The chatbot is designed to be helpful and respond naturally to user questions.

python
Copy code
# Define a prompt template for the chatbot
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the questions"),
        ("user", "Question: {question}")
    ]
)
